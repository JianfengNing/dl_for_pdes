This folder contains the code for the moving domain example, that is shown in section 6.4.1.
"compute_fluid.py" and "compute_temp.py" implement the training of the neural networks.

The networks that are shown in the paper are also given with:
    - final_p.pt
    - final_temp.pt
    - final_u.pt

TorchPhysics is needed to run this example.
